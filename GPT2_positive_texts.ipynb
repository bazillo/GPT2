    "### Results\n",
    "1. There is a significant improvement in reward metrics when fitting the model with DPOTrainer and using both loss_types, increasing from 0.67 to over 0.9. The sigmoid loss function demonstrates superior performance.\n",
    "2. Furthermore, there is a reduction in entropy. It is hypothesized that the decrease in the number of words is due to the model avoiding words with lower ranks. Additionally, the sigmoid loss function shows lower entropy.\n",
    "3. There is a significant drop down of loss while training model. However, there is no overfitting, because token entropy is still not too low\n",
    "\n",
    "### What to Enhance\n",
    "1. Expand the training and test datasets.\n",
    "2. Consider using an alternate method for creating the winner-loser dataset, such as human annotated data or a tournement-like model from Deepmind [SLI-HF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.10425.pdf)."
